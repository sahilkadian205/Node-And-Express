1) If you get error using 'nodemon filename' command on windows follow below steps - 
Open PowerShell (Run As Administrator)
Check the current execution policy using this command
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    # You should get 'Restricted'
Run this command to make it 'Unrestricted'
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Check again whether execution policy changed by running this command
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    # You should get 'Unrestricted'
Now try to run nodemon on your project
    nodemon 'filename.js'

2)If you're getting nodemon is not recognized then first check on cmd 
nodemon -v
if you don't get output then run command npm i -g nodemon
if you still face issue maybe path is not set properly.Do below-
Open cmd prompt and run -
npm config get prefix
after running above command you will get path something like this - 'C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\npm'.append this resulting path to PATH env variable.  

3)Creating environment variable
On windows goto cmd and type
set variablename=value
eg set port = 5000
If this doesn't work then add environment variable manually

On mac goto terminal and type
export variablename=value

Close and start the IDE (vscode or whatever you using)

4) Postman
select http request - post/put/get/delete
enter the url e.g - http://localhost:5000/api/courses
under body option choose raw format - radio button option
in drop down menu select json(application/json)
enter json based on requirement
Note - enter key in double quotes, value can be anything.If value is string then use double quotes.
eg. 
{
    "name":"course"
}
