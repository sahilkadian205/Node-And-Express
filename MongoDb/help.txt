1) After installing mongodb inside c: drive create a folder data and inside data folder create db folder - C:\data\db
All data is stored here in db folder.

2) Install mongodb compass as well. It's a mongodb GUI application.

3) In my case the mongoimport command was not available by default on the system (windows PC), so first download from the official website the 
additional tools provided by MongoDB, this includes mongoimport and others that you may not need.
download from below link -
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools 

export mongoimport.exe and paste this .exe file at "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin"
navigate using your terminal to the folder where the json file you want to import is located then run your mongoimport command.
